## Docker Instructions

### Docker - First install

Starting in the `Rocket-Bot` directory

1. `cd CosmoQuestBot-master`

2. Edit `.example-env` using your preferred IDE or text-editor. Fill out all necessary details (`DISCORD_TOKEN`, `NASA_API_KEY`, & `WEATHER_API_KEY`)

    > Try `nano .example-env`

3. After making your changes, save the file as `.env`. 

4. Run `docker build . -t rocket-bot:v2.3.2`



### Docker - Usage instructions

- Run `docker run --name rocket-bot-232 -d rocket-bot:v2.3.2` from anywhere on the system to start the bot
  - To auto-restart after a server reboot, add the tag `--restart always`

  > After the [first install](#docker---first-install), there is no need to run the build command until the next update. All the necessary packages have already been installed.

### Docker - Stopping the container

Eventually you might want to stop the container, run the following commands to accomplish this:

1. `docker ps` displays all running process; locate `rocket-bot:v2.3.2` & note the `Container ID`
    - if it returns no process, you need to change your context by running `docker context list` then `docker context use <context_not_marked_with_*>`
        - run step 1 again

2. `docker stop rocket-bot`

    > After a short time, it should return the Container Name you just entered, this means it stopped successfully.

3. `docker rm <container_id>` (optional)
    - Use this before updating to a new version
